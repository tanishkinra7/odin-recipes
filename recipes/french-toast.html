    <h1>French Toast</h1>

    <p>
      As you cook the French toast, bits of that nutty brown-butter flavor
      slowly develop — much slower than they would if you cooked with just
      butter alone — so the the French toast has time to cook evenly without
      burning. A neutral oil, like canola, is the way to go since it won't
      disrupt the flavor of the butter.
