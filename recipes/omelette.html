    <p>
      The major health benefits of omelettes are that they are packed with
      protein and healthy fats. Eggs help in regulating cholesterol levels in
      the body and improve eyesight since they are high in Vitamin A. There is
      some iodine in eggs too which is good for the thyroid gland.
